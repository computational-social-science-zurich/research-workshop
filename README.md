# Post-SICSS Research Workshop: 21-25 June 2021

In the week after SICSS-Zurich, there will be an in-person week in Zurich that we strongly encourage you to attend. Formally, this is an event separate from SICSS-Zurich, but we strongly encourage all SICSS-Zurich participants to also attend the post-SICSS in person week. This post-SICSS week focuses on participant-led group research projects. It offers an ideal opportunity to apply your newly acquired skills from the online week and to connect to other researchers who are interested in Computational Social Science.

Throughout this week, you will be working on a research proposal (in groups). At the end of the week, all groups present their proposal. The best proposal wins a seed project grant of CHF 1,500.

## About this repo

We will use this GitHub repo to share information about the Post-SICSS Research Workshop with you.

## Pre-event preparation

- Please prepare a short presentation of your research interests (not more than 5 to 7 minutes). This presentation should give an idea of who you are, what you have been working on so far, and in which direction you would like to develop. It is meant for participants to find their teammates for the research proposal more easily.
- Of course, you can start thinking about ideas that you could develop with your teammates during the Post-SICSS Research Workshop.

## Venue

All events will take place at ETH Zurich, IFW building (Haldeneggsteig 4). We will meet in room [RZ F 21](https://ethz.ch/services/de/service/raeume-gebaeude/rektoratsraeume/bilder-raeume/ifw-rz.html)
