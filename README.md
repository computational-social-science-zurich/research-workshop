# Post-SICSS Research Workshop: 21-25 June 2021

In the week after SICSS-Zurich, there will be an in-person week in Zürich that we strongly encourage you to attend. Formally, this is an event separate from SICSS-Zürich, but we strongly encourage all SICSS-Zürich participants to also attend the post-SICSS in person week. This post-SICSS week focuses on participant-led group research projects. It offers an ideal opportunity to apply your newly acquired skills from the online week and to connect to other researchers who are interested in Computational Social Science.
